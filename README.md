# BigInt Calculator

## Description

The BigInt Calculator is a C project developed as part of a school assignment. The project is designed to perform arithmetic operations on large integers, utilizing arrays and dynamic memory allocation to handle integers that exceed the size limitations of standard data types.

## Features

- **Addition**: Supports addition of large integers.
- **Subtraction**: Allows subtraction of large integers.
- **Multiplication**: Performs multiplication on large integers.
- **Division**: Handles division of large integers.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation to manage large integer sizes efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of C programming and memory management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bigint-calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd bigint-calculator
    ```
3. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    gcc -o bigint_calculator main.c
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the compiled executable:
    ```bash
    ./bigint_calculator
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to input large integers and select arithmetic operations.

## File Structure

- `main.c`: The single file containing all code for the project, including arithmetic functions and user interface. Due to the constraints of the school project, all functionalities are integrated into this file.
